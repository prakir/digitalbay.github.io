/**
 * [Stream Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) for `@xmpp/client`.
 *
 * Included and enabled in `@xmpp/client`.
 *
 * Supports Node.js and browsers.
 *
 * When the session is resumed the `online` event is not emitted as session resumption is transparent. However
 * `entity.status` is set to `online`. If the session fails to resume, entity will fallback to regular session
 * establishment in which case `online` event will be emitted.
 *
 * Automatically responds to acks but does not support requesting acks yet.
